# Connect-4

Connect-4 coded in C++ using SFML

To run the code, you can download the .exe from bin/release (NOT recommended), and the "fonts" folder, put them in the same directory, then run the .exe.

I recommend against downloading a .exe from some stranger. It's only a good idea if you just wanna see the game, yolo. It's safer to compile the code yourself.

If you would like to compile the code, you need SFML. Go to http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/ and pick your IDE under "Getting Started" then follow the instructions.
